[Keyoxide](https://keyoxide.org) is a modern, secure and decentralized platform to prove your online identity.

## Self-hosting

Self-hosting Keyoxide is an important aspect of the project. Users need to trust the Keyoxide instance they're using to reliably verify identities. Making Keyoxide itself decentralized means no one needs to trust a central server. If a friend or family member is hosting a Keyoxide instance, it becomes much easier to trust the instance!

### Docker

The Docker container allows you to easily self-host the [Keyoxide](https://keyoxide.org) project. To get started, simply run:

`docker run -d -p 3000:3000 keyoxide/keyoxide:stable`

Keyoxide will now be available by visiting http://localhost:3000.

More information available in the [documentation](docs.keyoxide.org/self-hosting).
